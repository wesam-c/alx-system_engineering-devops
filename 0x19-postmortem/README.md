## Postmortem: Unexpected Service Outage on GoalTracker Pro

Issue Summary
Duration: June 10, 2024, 14:00 UTC - June 10, 2024, 17:00 UTC

Impact: GoalTracker Pro was completely unavailable for 3 hours. Users were unable to log in, track goals, or update their progress. Approximately 85% of our users were affected, resulting in numerous complaints on social media and a spike in support tickets.

Root Cause: The outage was caused by an unexpected failure in our primary database cluster, which led to a cascade of failures throughout our application stack.

## Timeline
14:00 UTC: Issue detected by automated monitoring system alerting of high error rates and database connection failures.
14:05 UTC: Initial investigation began by on-call engineer; noticed database cluster was unresponsive.
14:10 UTC: Assumption made that the issue was due to a spike in traffic; scaling of database instances initiated.
14:30 UTC: Traffic spike theory disproved; error logs reviewed, showing no unusual traffic patterns.
14:45 UTC: Incident escalated to the database team for deeper investigation.
15:00 UTC: Database team identified potential issue with recent configuration changes.
15:15 UTC: Configuration changes rolled back; no improvement observed.
15:30 UTC: Misleading path investigated regarding application server issues, found unrelated to root cause.
16:00 UTC: Root cause identified as a faulty database cluster node causing network partitioning.
16:15 UTC: Faulty node isolated and removed from the cluster.
16:30 UTC: Database cluster stabilized; application services restarted.
17:00 UTC: Full service restored; monitoring confirmed stability.
## Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a faulty node within our primary database cluster. The faulty node caused network partitioning, which disrupted communication within the cluster and led to widespread connection failures. This issue was exacerbated by a recent configuration change intended to optimize database performance, which inadvertently reduced the fault tolerance of the cluster.

Resolution: To resolve the issue, the database team isolated and removed the faulty node from the cluster. The cluster configuration was then reverted to its previous state, restoring fault tolerance. After the cluster stabilized, all application services were restarted to ensure they could successfully reconnect to the database.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
## Improvements Needed:

Improve fault tolerance in database configurations.
Enhance monitoring to detect faulty nodes and network partitioning earlier.
Review and test configuration changes more thoroughly before deployment.
## Tasks:

Task 1: Patch and update the database cluster software to the latest version to improve stability and fault detection.
Task 2: Implement additional monitoring for network partitioning and node health within the database cluster.
Task 3: Review and update configuration change procedures to include more comprehensive testing and rollback plans.
Task 4: Conduct a training session for the engineering team on the new monitoring tools and procedures.
Task 5: Perform a postmortem review meeting to discuss lessons learned and gather feedback for further improvements.
By addressing these areas, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and ensure a more resilient and reliable service for our users. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this incident.
